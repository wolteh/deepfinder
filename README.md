# DeepFinder

This app lets you search files using the built-in macOS file system index, with some helpful features on top:

1.	Sort by Keyword Matches
You can enter multiple keywords, and the app will sort the results based on how many of those keywords are found in each file. It’s something Finder doesn’t do , super useful when you’re looking for files that match your search terms more closely.

2.	Natural Language to Keywords
Instead of thinking up all the right keywords yourself, you can just type what you’re looking for in plain English. The app can use AI (OpenAI or Olama) to turn that into a keyword list for you.

3.	Assistant Mode
If you’re not sure how to phrase your query, there’s an Assistant mode. The AI will ask a few follow-up questions to better understand what you’re after, then generate the keywords from that.

4.	Automatic File Tagging
The app can also tag your files using AI, based on categories you set in the settings. This can help make future searches a lot quicker.
